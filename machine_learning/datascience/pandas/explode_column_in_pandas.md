## Explode Columns
In Pandas, the explode() function is used to transform or “explode” a list-like column, where each element in a list-like entry becomes a separate row, replicating the rest of the data. This is particularly useful when you have a column containing lists or arrays, and you want to flatten those into multiple rows.

**Example of explode():**
Let’s say you have a DataFrame where one of the columns contains lists, and you want to explode that column so that each element of the list gets its own row.
```python
import pandas as pd

# Sample DataFrame with a column containing lists
data = {
    'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'],
    'Hobbies': [['Reading', 'Hiking'], ['Cooking'], ['Swimming', 'Cycling', 'Running']]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print("Original DataFrame:")
print(df)

# Explode the 'Hobbies' column
df_exploded = df.explode('Hobbies')

print("\nExploded DataFrame:")
print(df_exploded)
```


```python
Original DataFrame:
      Name                    Hobbies
0    Alice           [Reading, Hiking]
1      Bob                   [Cooking]
2  Charlie  [Swimming, Cycling, Running]

Exploded DataFrame:
      Name    Hobbies
0    Alice    Reading
0    Alice     Hiking
1      Bob    Cooking
2  Charlie   Swimming
2  Charlie    Cycling
2  Charlie     Running
```
