Improves model and performance by changing numerical values into the same exact scale.

### Two Ways
- Normalization
- Standardization

### Normalization
Values are set between 0 to 1.

$$X_{\text{norm}} = \frac{X - X_{\min}}{X_{\max} - X_{\min}}$$

### Standardization
Mean of 0.
SD of 1.

$$Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}$$

	•	Z is the standardized value (z-score),
	•	X is the original value,
	•	\mu is the mean of the dataset
	•	\sigma is the standard deviation of the dataset.
