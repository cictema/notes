All programming involves math.
Machine learning is programming by optimization.
We need math to understand that optimization.


## Linear Algebra
To understand the objects being optimized.
For example, data and models are arrays.


## Calculus
To understand how we optimize.
With tiny changes.

## Probability and Statistics
To understand what we want to optimize.
Reduce surprise/uncertainty
