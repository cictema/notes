in physics:
- an arrow in space
- two factors
	- length
	- direction
- can be 2d and 3d

in CS:
- lists of numbers
- order matters in this sequence of numbers 
- [100, 500] is not equal to [500, 100]
- can be seen as a fancy word for lists of numbers
- dimension: length of list

In maths:
- generalizes both these principles
- can be anything as long as there are operations such as multiplying by a number, or adding two vectors
- two important operations:
	- adding two vectors
	- multiplying by a number

## Geometric Focus
---
- Think about vectors sitting in 3d space rooted at origin in the coordinate system.
- Coordinates tell us:
	- how to get from origin to its tip
	- [-2,3]
		- first number tells you how long to walk along the x axis
		- second number tells you how long to walk along the parallel to the y axis
		- negative number for x-axis: left
		- negative number for y-axis: down
	- 3d:
		- add z-axis
- Adding Two Vectors:
	- To add two vectors:
		- Move one vector so that its tail sits at the tip of the other one
		- then draw a new vector from the tail of the first vector to the tip of the second vector
		- that is the sum of the two vectors
		- displacement, not sum
		- [1,2] + [3-1] = move 1+3 to the right, and 2-1 up 
- Multiplication:
	- Stretch out by its multiplier
	- 2v = 2 x v
	- Negative number: 
		- reverse direction, and scale
	- scaling
		- with a scaler
	- 2 [1,2] = [1x2, 2x2]

##### Linear Algebra revolves around Addition and Multiplication.
