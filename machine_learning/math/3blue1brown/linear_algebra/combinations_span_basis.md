## Basis Vectors
- Think of each vector coordinate as a scaler multiplying with unit vectors
- the unit vectors i and j are called the `basis` of the xy coordinate system
- what if we choose two different basis vectors
	- still a valid way of moving back and forth in 2d space
- an implicit standard

## Linear Combination
- whenever we add and scale two vectors, its a linear combination
- a.v + b.w

## Span
- the set of all possible vectors we could reach with a linear combination is called the span
- the span of v and w in a.v+b.w is the set of all their linear combinations
	- using addition and scaling

## Linearly Dependent
If two vectors line up, or the third vector sits in the span of the first two, then they are linearly dependent.


## Technical Definition of Basis:
The basis of a vector space is a set of linearly independent vectors that span the full space.
