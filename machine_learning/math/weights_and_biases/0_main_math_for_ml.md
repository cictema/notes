All programming involves math.
Machine learning is programming by optimization.
We need math to understand that optimization.


## [[linear_algebra_for_ml]]
To understand the objects being optimized.
For example, data and models are arrays.


## [[calculus_for_ml]]
To understand how we optimize.
With tiny changes.

## [[probability_and_stats_for_ml]]
To understand what we want to optimize.
Reduce surprise/uncertainty
