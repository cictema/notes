## Components
- **Language model**: It is the backbone of LangChain. It generates text, translates languages, and provides relevant answers to the questions.
- **Prompt**: It is a short text that is used to create a way to make the model work, like when we ask a question to get an answer.
- **Chain**: Sequence of prompts to generate a more complex response.
- **Session**: Context that is used to store the state of the language model and the chain.


## Funtionalities
- It offers a uniform user interface for interacting with the LLMs. This makes building LLM applications smoother.
- It also provides many functionalities and tools to optimize the LLM applicationâ€™s performance, including text generation, prompt generation, and chaining prompts together.
- There is a facility for testing with various LLMs and their configurations to help the users identify the best LLM for performing the specific operation.
