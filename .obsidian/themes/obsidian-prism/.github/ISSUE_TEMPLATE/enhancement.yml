      description: What version of Primary are you using? To check, open up `Settings` in Obsidian. Then go to the `Appearance` tab and under `Themes`, press `Manage`. Look for Primary and click it. It should open up the info page for Primary and at top, you will find `Version`. Any version below v2.0.0 will not be entertained as these versions are no longer supported.
