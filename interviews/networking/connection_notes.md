I was researching the VP of Customer Success role on your team. Your search for someone who has worked on {{X}} and {{Y}} caught my attention.

Over the past 8 years, I have
– Led and mentored teams of 8+ CSMs
– Managed $25M+ ARR while implementing effective upselling strategies.
– Grown ARR 17% YOY by articulating the platform's value to customers and decreasing churn from 5.4% to 3.1%

If you think it makes sense, would you be open to hopping on a call to share a bit more about this role and how you’ve liked working with {{COMPANY}}?
